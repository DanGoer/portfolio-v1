    "My personal portfolio website where I present my projects. This is an <strong>SEO</strong> optimized <strong>Next.js</strong> web APP.\n A portfolio needs to be fast, easy to understand and to the point. That's why I chose <strong>Server Side Rendering</strong> (SSR) for the architecture. This is also reflected in the developer console tool <strong>Lighthouse analytics</strong> with a rating of <strong>100/100</strong>.\n A portfolio should be fast and reliable. To create consistent and repeatable design elements with beautiful effects, third-party libraries <strong>Framer Motion</strong> and <strong>TailwindCSS</strong> support the design.\n To accommodate multilingualism, <strong>I18next</strong> was used. This allows me to quickly add more languages. At the moment <strong>English</strong> and <strong>German</strong> are supported.\n To sum it up: My portfolio is a <strong>minimalistic</strong> but <strong>feature-rich</strong> and <strong>bulletproof</strong> web APP written using <strong>TypeScript</strong> as my language of choice.",
